## Modernizing Books

Books are an amazing technology. By far, books rank amongst the best inventions humanity has ever managed. Countless readers and writers have been directly benefited by the existence of books over the millennia. Books have offered wisdom, solace, knowledge and experience that continues to be unrivaled by much newer technologies up to and including the Internet. It is due to the veracity of books' value, that the *technology* that is books is roughly the same as it was 500 years ago.

Bramdroid is the first of its kind experience to show what books can be when computational power is added to the technology. Bramdroid is a Discord bot that allows you to interact with books in a way that was never before possible.

But first, let's talk about the current landscape of reading and computation.

### The Landscapes

To understand the value of Bramdroid, it is important to understand the current landscape of reading and computation.

#### Books

Books are a very old technology. They are so old in fact, that it is hard to pinpoint when they were invented. It is likely that books were invented independently in many places around the world, and even that claim is heavily dependent on your definition of what a book qualifies as. The *earliest surviving book* is from the Tang Dynasty, the [Diamond Sutra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_Sutra) circa 868 CE.

Since the printing press was invented in 1440, books have been printed in roughly the same way, albeit the technology today is much faster than the typesetting of Gutenberg's era. The printing press was a huge leap forward in the technology of the dissemination of books. The printing press allowed for books to be mass produced, but it did not change the way that books were read at the individual level.

Much of the recent digitization of books has been focused on making them more accessible by weight and convenience, but not more interactive. Thanks to E-readers, we can now carry thousands of books in our pockets. In a sense, we have turned the printing press from a hardware technology into a software technology. If an author wants to publish a book, they can do so without the need for a printing press, or even pressing "print" on their computer, for that matter.

But we still cannot interact with books in any meaningful way outside of...reading.

#### Reading

When a reader consumes a novel, or is studying a leading book on some subject they care to know more about, they leverage tactics that have been around for centuries. They highlight passages, they take notes, they write in the margins, they dog-ear pages and leave coffee-stained bookmarks in pages. These old, common actions between all serious readers tells us a very, very important detail about reading. These actions tell us that the information that are in books are **not evenly distributed**. Some parts of books are **more relevant** to the reader than others.

Even more frustratingly, highlights will vary from reader to reader. A reader may highlight a passage that another reader may not find interesting at all. This is because the information in books is **not evenly distributed** between readers either. This makes reading a quite solitary activity. It is hard to share the experience of reading with others, because the information that is relevant to you is not necessarily relevant to others.

Reading, is a very **passive** activity. The reader consumes the information in the book once -- maybe twice if it's a really good read, and that's it. The reader may take notes, but the book itself does not change. The book is a static object that is the same for every reader, frozen in time. The information is delivered linearly, and the reader has no control over the order in which they consume the information outside of skipping around the book manually.

But must these facts be the case? As we have discussed, the highlights are dynamic from reader to reader, so why can't the book be dynamic as well?

Now let's level up from a single book to the entire library.

## Features

New features are added all the time as creativity strikes, but here are some of the current features:

### Slash Commands

#### `/curio`

1. Bramdroid will ask you three questions from random quotes.
2. You pick the question that you think is the most interesting and piques your curiosity.
3. Bramdroid will run the `/quos` command (below) on the question you picked.

#### `/random`

...

#### `/quos`

Power user command to search the database directly for quotes.

#### `/help`

Will display a help message with all the commands and their descriptions.

### Button Interactions

#### `delve`

...

#### `tldr`

...

#### `aart`

## Usage

## Invocation Limits

## Installation

Bramdroid is pretty bespoke, and is unlikely to be useful to anyone else due to its specificity.

However, there are some tactics that can be used to inspire your own bots of a similar caliber.
